A project to determine a promising tariff for a telecom company
Description of the project:

You are an analyst at Megaline, a federal mobile operator. Customers are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". 
To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money. 
You have the data of 500 Megalyne users at your disposal: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018.
